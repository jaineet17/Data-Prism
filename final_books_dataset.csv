This groundbreaking and powerful theory now forms the basis of computer science. In Turings Vision , Chris Bernhardt explains the theory, Turings most important contribution, for the general reader. Bernhardt argues that the strength of Turings theory is its simplicity, and that, explained in a straightforward manner, it is eminently understandable by the nonspecialist. As Marvin Minsky writes, The sheer simplicity of the theorys foundation and extraordinary short path from this foundation to its logical and surprising conclusions give the theory a mathematical beauty that alone guarantees it a permanent place in computer theory. Bernhardt begins with the foundation and systematically builds to the surprising conclusions. He also views Turings theory in the context of mathematical history, other views of computation including those of Alonzo Church, Turings later work, and the birth of the modern computer. In the paper, On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem , Turing thinks carefully about how humans perform computation, breaking it down into a sequence of steps, and then constructs theoretical machines capable of performing each step. Turing wanted to show that there were problems that were beyond any computers ability to solve in particular, he wanted to find a decision problem that he could prove was undecidable. To explain Turings ideas, Bernhardt examines three wellknown decision problems to explore the concept of undecidability investigates theoretical computing machines, including Turing machines explains universal machines and proves that certain problems are undecidable, including Turings problem concerning computable numbers.

From once being an esoteric question of philosophy, this subject has become a central topic in the foundations of quantum physics. The book traces this story back to Descartes, through Kant, to the beginnings of 20th Century physics, where it becomes clear that the mindworld relationship is not a speculative question but has a direct impact on the understanding of physical phenomena. The books argument begins with the British empiricists who raised our awareness of the fact that we have no direct contact with physical reality, but it is the mind that constructs the form and features of objects. It is shown that modern cognitive science brings this insight a step further by suggesting that shape and structure are not internal to objects, but arise in the observer. The author goes yet further by arguing that the meaningful connectedness between things the hierarchical organization of all we perceive is the result of the Gestalt nature of perception and thought, and exists only as a property of mind. These insights give the first glimmerings of a new way of seeing the cosmos not as a mineral wasteland but a place inhabited by creatures. Read more"

If you have to start from scratch and write something, you will need to define things like an image, a point, a rectangle, and so on. Almost every computer vision algorithm needs these. All of these basic structures are already built into OpenCV. They are all in the core module. Another benefit is that these frameworks are already optimized for speed and memory, so users dont have to bother about the specifics of implementation. The imgcodecs module is in charge of opening and saving image files. With a simple command, you can save the output image as either a jpg or a png file when youre done with it. When you work with cameras, you will have to deal with a lot of video files. There are different modules that take care of everything that has to do with putting and taking out video files. You can easily record a video from a webcam or read a video file in various formats. You can also set properties like frames per second, frame size, and so on to save a bunch of frames as a video file. Processes for handling images When you write a Computer Vision algorithm, you will use a lot of the same basic image processing steps over and over. The imgproc module has most of these functions. You can do things like image filtering, geometric transformations, morphological operations, drawing on images, color conversions, histograms, motion analysis, shape analysis, feature detection, and so on. In OpenCV, we only need one line to do many of these manipulatinos, as you would see in this OpenCV course. Read more"

He succeeds well in choosing the topics both theory and practice that will be useful to practitioners, and for the reader who understands that this is the first 100 or actually 150 pages you will read, not the last, provides a solid introduction to the field. Aurlien Gron , Senior AI Engineer, author of the bestseller HandsOn Machine Learning with ScikitLearn and TensorFlow The breadth of topics the book covers is amazing for just 100 pages plus few bonus pages. Burkov doesnt hesitate to go into the math equations thats one thing that short books usually drop. I really liked how the author explains the core concepts in just a few words. The book can be very useful for newcomers in the field, as well as for oldtimers who can gain from such a broad view of the field.

Gareth James , Professor of Data Sciences and Operations, coauthor of the bestseller An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in R This is a compact how to do data science manual and I predict it will become a goto resource for academics and practitioners alike. At 100 pages or a little more, the book is short enough to read in a single sitting. Yet, despite its length, it covers all the major machine learning approaches, ranging from classical linear and logistic regression, through to modern support vector machines, deep learning, boosting, and random forests. There is also no shortage of details on the various approaches and the interested reader can gain further information on any particular method via the innovative companion book wiki. The book does not assume any high level mathematical or statistical training or even programming experience, so should be accessible to almost anyone willing to invest the time to learn about these methods. It should certainly be required reading for anyone starting a PhD program in this area and will serve as a useful reference as they progress further. Finally, the book illustrates some of the algorithms using Python code, one of the most popular coding languages for machine learning. I would highly recommend The HundredPage Machine Learning Book for both the beginner looking to learn more about machine learning and the experienced practitioner seeking to extend their knowledge base.

Rather than describing deep learning as an implementation technique, as is usually the case in many existing deep learning books, here, deep learning is explained as an ultimate form of signal processing techniques that can be imagined. To support this claim, an overview of classical kernel machine learning approaches is presented, and their advantages and limitations are explained. Following a detailed explanation of the basic building blocks of deep neural networks from a biological and algorithmic point of view, the latest tools such as attention, normalization, Transformer, BERT, GPT3, and others are described. Here, too, the focus is on the fact that in these heuristic approaches, there is an important, beautiful geometric structure behind the intuition that enables a systematic understanding. A unified geometric analysis to understand the working mechanism of deep learning from highdimensional geometry is offered. Then, different forms of generative models like GAN, VAE, normalizing flows, optimal transport, and so on are described from a unified geometric perspective, showing that they actually come from statistical distanceminimization problems. Because this book contains uptodate information from both a practical and theoretical point of view, it can be used as an advanced deep learning textbook in universities or as a reference source for researchers interested in acquiring the latest deep learning algorithms and their underlying principles. In addition, the book has been prepared for a codeshare course for both engineering and mathematics students, thus much of the content is interdisciplinary and will appeal to students from both disciplines.

How do you show relationships in data? When is showing variances more valuable than showing actual data values? How do you deal with outliers? How do you bucket data in the most meaningful way? How do you show impossible amounts of data without inundating your audience? In Data Visualization with Excel Reports and Dashboards , readers will get answers to all of these questions. Part technical manual, part analytical guidebook this title will help Excel users go from reporting data with simple tables full of dull numbers, to creating hiimpact reports and dashboards that will wow management both visually and substantively.

With complex information everywhere, graphics have become indispensable to our daily lives. Navigation apps show realtime, interactive traffic data. A colorcoded map of exit polls details election balloting down to the county level. Charts communicate stock market trends, government spending, and the dangers of epidemics. A History of Data Visualization and Graphic Communication tells the story of how graphics left the exclusive confines of scientific research and became ubiquitous. As data visualization spread, it changed the way we think. Michael Friendly and Howard Wainer take us back to the beginnings of graphic communication in the midseventeenth century, when the Dutch cartographer Michael Florent van Langren created the first chart of statistical data, which showed estimates of the distance from Rome to Toledo. By 1786 William Playfair had invented the line graph and bar chart to explain trade imports and exports. In the nineteenth century, the golden age of data display, graphics found new uses in tracking disease outbreaks and understanding social issues. Friendly and Wainer make the case that the explosion in graphical communication both reinforced and was advanced by a cognitive revolution visual thinking. Across disciplines, people realized that information could be conveyed more effectively by visual displays than by words or tables of numbers. Through stories and illustrations, A History of Data Visualization and Graphic Communication details the 400year evolution of an intellectual framework that has become essential to both science and society at large.

He identifies six historical phases of infographics in popular culture the protoinfographic, the classical, the improving, the commercial, the ideological, and the professional. Dick describes the emergence of infographic forms within a wider history of journalism, culture, and communications, focusing his analysis on the UK. He considers their use in the partisan British journalism of late eighteenth and early nineteenthcentury print media their later deployment as a vehicle for reform and improvement their massmarket debut in the twentieth century as a means of explanation and sometimes propaganda and their use for both ideological and professional purposes in the postWorld War II marketized newspaper culture. Finally, he proposes best practices for news infographics and defends infographics and data visualization against a range of criticism. Dick offers not only a history of how the public has experienced and understood the infographic, but also an account of what data visualization can tell us about the past. Read more"

"War and Peace - C# Programming 4 Vol.: Programming in C# Visual Studio - Arrays, File Manipulation, Console Apps (War and Peace - C# Programming Visual Studio 2022)  ",Not Found,5  ,4.8,14.0,https://www.amazon.com/War-Peace-Programming-Manipulation-Console-ebook/dp/B09QZZ42HT/ref=sr_1_40?keywords=R+Programming&qid=1669446473&sr=8-40,"This is the fourth of a sixvolume set and these topics are more advanced than previous chapters. Here you will learn how to apply Arrays to common business problems, how to manipulate files, folders, and subdirectories, and how to write unattended background applications. If you have completed the first volume, then this volume is wellwithin the reach of a beginning student. Click the look inside to see a sample. Volume Details Chapter 22 Arrays Arrays solve tons of problems with grace and speed and I am embarrassed to tell you this chapter is 180 pages long, with 85 illustrations to help explain the concepts. You may have noticed arrays being used in earlier chapters. This ties the concepts together. This is an involved chapter and it requires careful study. Topics include single and multidimensioned arrays, as well as the newerstyled list arrays. Although List arrays are touted as the simpler way to manage stacks of data, much of the chapter revolves around traditional arrays. These are still needed, and I show why. Much effort is devoted to overallocating arrays which solves the vexing problem of how to size an array when the number of elements are not known. It also covers how to resize 2D arrays, something Microsoft does not offer. Sorting arrays can be remarkably complicated. Learn how to sort multiple linked arrays 2 or more, and how to sort 2D arrays topics which few internet articles dare to tread. These are gnarly problems but are described with clear examples. Build multiple indexes on 2D arrays, and learn how to sequentially search an array. Then, amazingly, I show how to write a binary search on a multidimensioned array again, something Microsoft does not support. These are topics you want to know. This chapter makes me proud. Chapter 23 File Manipulations Use C to move, copy, and delete files, find parent directories, convert drive letters to UNC paths, and other filebased goodies that are just plain handy. Details on folders, filedates, and other disklevel activities are illustrated and almost all have gotchas. This chapter shows how to avoid the most common problems, using both brief overviews and goldplated solutions. Chapter 24 Console Applications Console applications are DOSlike programs that do not have windows, buttons or mouse controls and they are typically written for servers and for unattended tasks. If you are writing unattended programs, this is the chapter to study. Surprisingly, most applications I write are Console apps. Other volumes in this series This series is being distributed through Amazon Kindle as a multi volume set in order to make printing manageable.

This book is geared towards beginning programmers and it teaches the dataprocessing techniques you need to know. The goal is to have as much time on the keyboard, working with common business problems I call this real work programs. Series Intro This series is distributed through Amazon as a multi volume set to keep printing manageable. All six volumes are 2,100pages, with 1300 illustrations. Six volumes is admittedly daunting, but I promise each section is approachable and you can do this. Most people start with Volume1 and Volume6 Student Projects. Because this is Kindle, each book and the entire series is inexpensive. My writing is different than most. Little time is spent on theories and technical sidetrips are rare. There are no HelloWorld programs, nor will you find consoleapps. Instead, after Chapter 1, you will immediately begin work on loops, ifstatements, and stringmanipulation. All work done in a real Windows Form program. Each topic has stepbystep instructions with numerous code examples. All code blocks are liberally commented. Illustrations are closelycropped and annotated no spacewasting fullscreen shots. Where others might spend a page or two on a topic, I dive into the most common and most useful ways to solve a problem. For example, 60 pages are dedicated to loops covering while loops, fornext loops, and others. Learn bestpractices on which type of loop to use and how to control them. Knowing not all is rosy in loopville, learn about common mistakes, infinite loops, and other problems all with lots of examples. Nearly 200 pages are devoted to strings and how to manipulate them, starting with Chapter 4, which covers the escape codes, ASCII characters, padding, trimming, substrings, and the like. These go beyond this is a keyword and here is an example. I show the nutsandbolts stuff you need to know. A Phenomenal Utilities Library After that, in Chapter 6 Volume 1, I take Cs relatively obtuse substring commands and I show you how to write your own routines Utilities. This may sound geeky, but you will invent what essentially become new C keywords for RightString, LeftString, MidString and ParseBetweenDelimiters, and more. There are 35 routines and each acts as a miniprogram. These automate mundane tasks, such as detecting blank values surprisingly complicated, detecting numeric fields when the numbers might contain dollarsigns, commas, and decimals, and how to validate email addresses. There are dozens more, each with a specific goal. Keep inmind that Microsoft does not do any of these natively. I show how to convert these utilities into a shared library that can be reused in all of your programs. These become your utilities you write them and you will never have to write a parse again. This saves boatloads of time. If there is a chance of making a mistake in punctuation, style, or logic, you will see how to identify and solve the problem. Compiler errors are scattered throughout the book and there is a comprehensive error reference in the appendix, with likely causes and recommendations. All of this in Volume 1 The other volumes cover topics such as looping through ASCII files, building multiform programs, parsing CSV files, formatting, SQL, and more. Each with the depth needed in the real world. If you just want to get your feet wet, try the standalone Volume 6 Student and Instructor Workbook Six fun and interesting projects that will showcase the power of Visual Studios C.

"War and Peace - C# Programming 2 Vol.: Programming in C# with Visual Studio - Class Libraries, Forms, ASCII Files, Parsing (War and Peace - C# Programming Visual Studio 2022)  ",Not Found,4  ,4.7,14.0,https://www.amazon.com/War-Peace-Programming-Libraries-Parsing-ebook/dp/B09XJH2XWH/ref=sr_1_55?keywords=R+Programming&qid=1669446473&sr=8-55,"This is the second of a sixvolume set with topics of interest for beginning students but these chapters quickly jump into the weeds with technical details that all programmers need to know. 560 pages. See a sample of this book by clicking Look Inside. Volume 2 Details Chapter 8 Class Libraries This takes the utilities from chapters 17 and rolls them into a reuseable classlibrary that can be dropped into any program. This is important You will never have to write another substring or a parsing routine again. While building this library, learn how to pass values toandfrom class libraries, which lays the groundwork for larger and more complicated programs. Chapter 9 Variable Scope Learn how variables rise and fall, come into being and die. This is an important concept and with this you can perform magic inside of loops and arrays and this keeps a program from having memory leaks. Chapter 10 Forms Covers everything about Windows forms, every useful button and event, covered in the details you want to know. CombBoxes, textBoxes, radio and checkboxes, calendars, etc. learn how these things really work. Practical discussions on Events, and properties. With this chapter, learn how to make your enduser forms sing. Chapter 11 Secondary Forms How to write a multiformed program is the goal of this chapter. The Internet is surprisingly unhelpful, but this chapter puts it all in one place. As usual, I show the good ways to do this and the bad, and I explain why you should care. As icing on the cake, this chapter shows how to write the missing InputBox a form that Microsoft forgot to put in their language. Now, when you need to prompt the user for a simple oneline field, you can call a generic routine, that is functional and more attractive than Microsofts standard MessageBox. By the end of this chapter, you will have no qualms about adding a second or third form to a program. The technique is described in detail, but there is also a great cookbookapproach where you can bang these things out. Chapter 12 ASCII Almost every program needs to open, read, and process ASCII files This is something you need to know. Use these skills to rifle through a .CSV or Tab file, parsing fields. This includes great errortrapping and other best practices. Lots of good examples. Chapter 13 Parsing CSV and TAB files Parse any CSV or Tabdelimited file even those with nasty embedded commas the kind that makes Microsofts whimpy .split command cry. When you are done with this chapter, you will have a nifty utility that automates parsing with a oneword command. This is so cool it defies description. This is a complicated chapter. Between volume 1s substrings, parsebetweendelimiters, and ParseKeyValue, and this chapters parsing logic, you will find over 200 pages and a hundred illustrations. A lot of ink is being devoted to this topic because this is the breadandbutter of most programs. I am excited by these chapters and I use these routines in my daily work. These are my goto functions that save untold hours of work. With zero effort, I can dropin a simple command that does amazingly complicated things. What is neat about these modules is they are yours free to use in any program, and most importantly, you will have the skills to enhance and extend them for your own needs. This series is being distributed through Amazon Kindle as a multi volume set in order to make printing manageable. All four volumes are 2,100pages long, with 1,300 illustrations. The Utility functions in Volume 1 are required in all future chapters, and are downloadable for free from the author. Thank you for purchasing. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have had writing it.

Integrate and copy data from your transactional systems into a specialized relational database, apply BI reporting and query tools and add business users. Job done. No longer. Analytics, big data and an array of diverse technologies have changed everything. More importantly, business is insisting on ever more value, ever faster from information and from IT in general. An emerging biztech ecosystem demands that business and IT work together. Business unIntelligence reflects the new reality that in todays socially complex and rapidly changing world, business decisions must be based on a combination of rational and intuitive thinking. Integrating cues from diverse information sources and tacit knowledge, decision makers create unique meaning to innovate heuristically at the speed of thought. This book provides a wealth of new models that business and IT can use together to design support systems for tomorrows successful organizations. Dr. Barry Devlin, one of the earliest proponents of data warehousing, goes back to basics to explore how the modern trinity of information, process and people must be reinvented and restructured to deliver the value, insight and innovation required by modern businesses. From here, he develops a series of novel architectural models that provide a new foundation for holistic information use across the entire business. From discovery to analysis and from decision making to action taking, he defines a fully integrated, closedloop business environment. Covering every aspect of business analytics, big data, collaborative working and more, this book takes over where BI ends to deliver the definitive framework for information use in the coming years. As the person who defined the conceptual framework and physical architecture for data warehousing in the 1980s, Barry Devlin has been an astute observer of the movement he initiated ever since. Now, in Business unintelligence , Devlin provides a sweeping view of the past, present, and future of business intelligence, while delivering new conceptual and physical models for how to turn information into insights and action. Reading Devlins prose and vision of BI are comparable to reading Carl Sagans view of the cosmos. The book is truly illuminating and inspiring.

Though its easy to blame authoritarian leadership or the like, poor decision making is far more usually due to not really knowing what to do with the available information, whether its sufficient and what else needs to be known There?s nothing weird or idiotic about today?s decision makers, but there often is about the tools and methods available to them. It would be more accurate to say that many decision makers have been lead astray regarding their remit and capacity, but fortunately with structured decision processes they can be guided back on track far more easily than had they been as dim witted as some of their decisions would indicate.Businesses introduce various BI solutions both timely and untimely, but what most of them dont have is any kind of methodology by which to deal with decisions. With no processes, knowledge, techniques or tools, they soon come to grief. Happily this is fairly easy to remedy.Decision processes and decision methods can be greatly improved. In this book we simply explain how to go about it. Read more"

This has led to an increasing demand for powerful software tools to help people analyze and manage vast amounts of text data effectively and efficiently. Unlike data generated by a computer system or sensors, text data are usually generated directly by humans, and are accompanied by semantically rich content. As such, text data are especially valuable for discovering knowledge about human opinions and preferences, in addition to many other kinds of knowledge that we encode in text. In contrast to structured data, which conform to welldefined schemas thus are relatively easy for computers to handle, text has less explicit structure, requiring computer processing toward understanding of the content encoded in text. The current technology of natural language processing has not yet reached a point to enable a computer to precisely understand natural language text, but a wide range of statistical and heuristic approaches to analysis and management of text data have been developed over the past few decades. They are usually very robust and can be applied to analyze and manage text data in any natural language, and about any topic. This book provides a systematic introduction to all these approaches, with an emphasis on covering the most useful knowledge and skills required to build a variety of practically useful text information systems. The focus is on text mining applications that can help users analyze patterns in text data to extract and reveal useful knowledge. Information retrieval systems, including search engines and recommender systems, are also covered as supporting technology for text mining applications. The book covers the major concepts, techniques, and ideas in text data mining and information retrieval from a practical viewpoint, and includes many handson exercises designed with a companion software toolkit i.e., MeTA to help readers learn how to apply techniques of text mining and information retrieval to realworld text data and how to experiment with and improve some of the algorithms for interesting application tasks. The book can be used as a textbook for a computer science undergraduate course or a reference book for practitioners working on relevant problems in analyzing and managing text data. Read more"

The question subjects e.g using the Stocks table, using Flights table, etc, actions e.g. create a crosstabchart, how can you ..., etc, and conditions which is the most probable, which is the best reason, etc, also follow the Tableau Sample Exam Format. A candidate preparing for the exam will expend about the same time and apply about the same mental effort understanding the question as he would in the real test center environment. P.S. If you are learning Tableau I recommend you first take the Tableau Desktop Specialist Exam. There are two advantages i you get familiarized with the Tableau Exam format and the online exam environment administered by Loyalist Exam Services, lcsexams.com, and ii the exam fee is just 100 and your Tableau Desktop Specialist certification title does not expire. P.S.S. A final comment about the validity of the answers each practice exam question is followed by an answer, explanation of the answer, and explanation of why other multiple choices are wrong. The links between two and four to the free online resources are provided Tableau documentation, other documentation, pdf articles, blogs, and videos. Some questions on a real Tableau Exam are not precisely worded. Sometimes two multiplechoice options appear to be an almost equally acceptable answer. You should not get too worked up over that if you use these practice exams as one of the building blocks of your studies, you should be able to demonstrate your broad Tableau Desktop knowledge in a job interview and you should be able to pass the Tableau Desktop Specialist Exam 70 passing score required.

IT projects designed to provide employees with dashboards, KPIs, and businessintelligence tools often take a year or more to reach the finish line...if they get there at all. This has always been a problem. Today, though, its downright unacceptable. The world changes faster than ever. Speed has never been more important. By adhering to antiquated methods, firms lose the ability to see nascent trends and act upon them until its too late. But what if the process of turning raw data into meaningful insights didnt have to be so painful, timeconsuming, and frustrating? What if there were a better way to do analytics? Fortunately, youre in luck.... Analytics The Agile Way demonstrates how progressive organizations such as Google, Nextdoor, and others approach analytics in a fundamentally different way. They are applying the same Agile techniques that software developers have employed for years. They have replaced large batches in favor of smaller ones...and their results will astonish you.

Yet strategic initiatives continue to fail as often as they did when computers ran on punch cards. Economist and research scientist Alec Levenson says we need a new approach. The problem, Levenson says, is that the business people who devise the strategies and the human resources people who get employees to implement them use completely different analytics. Business analytics can determine if operational priorities arent being achieved but cant explain why. HR analytics reveal potentially helpful policy and process improvements but cant identify which would have the greatest strategic impact. This book shows how to use an integrated approach to bring these two pieces together. Levenson presents a thorough and realistic treatment of the reasons for and challenges of taking an integrated approach. He provides details on the different parts of both enterprise and human capital analytics that have to be conducted for integration to be successful and includes specific questions to ask, along with examples of applying integrated analytics to address particular organizational challenges. Effective analytics is a team sport. Levensons approach allows you to get the deepest insights by bringing people together from both the business and HR perspectives to assess whats going on and determine the right solution. Read more"

"A Fan's Guide to Baseball Analytics: Why WAR, WHIP, wOBA, and Other Advanced Sabermetrics Are Essential to Understanding Modern Baseball  ",Anthony Castrovince,511  ,4.7,16.99,https://www.amazon.com/Fans-Guide-Baseball-Analytics-Understanding/dp/1683583442/ref=sr_1_42?keywords=Analytics&qid=1669446489&sr=8-42,"Broken up into sections pitching, fielding, hitting, this authoritative yet fun and easy guide will help readers young and old fully understand and comprehend the statistics that are the present and future of our national pastime. We all know what a .300 hitter looks like. The same with a 20game winner. Those numbers are ingrained in our brains. But do they mean as much as we think? Do we feel the same way when we hear a batter has a .390 wOBA? How about a pitcher with a 1.2 WHIP? These statistics are the future of modern baseball, and no fan should be in the dark about how these metrics apply to the game. In the last twenty years, an avalanche of analytics has taken over the way the game is played, managed, and assessed, but the statistics that drive the sport metrics like wRC, FIP, and WAR, just to name a few read like alphabet soup to a large number of fans who still think batting average, RBIs, and wins are the best barometers for baseball players. In A Fans Guide to Baseball Analytics , MLB.com reporter and columnist Anthony Castrovince has taken on the role as explainer to help such fans understand why the old stats dont always add up. Readers will also learn where these modern stats came from, what they convey, and how to use them to evaluate players of the present, past, and future. For instance, what if we told you that when Joe DiMaggio had his famous 56game hitting streak in 1941, helping him win the AL MVP, that there was, perhaps, someone more deserving? In fact, the great Ted Williams actually had a higher fWAR, bWAR, wRC, OPS, OPS, ISO, RC . . . well, you get the picture. So, streak or no streak, Williams should have been league MVP. An introductory course on sabermetrics, A Fans Guide to Baseball Analytics is an easily digestible resource that readers can keep turning back to when they see a modern metric referenced in todays baseball coverage.

In 2013, NBA point guard Steph Curry wowed crowds when he sunk 11 out of 13 threepointers for a game total of 54 pointsonly seven other players, including Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, had scored more in a game at Madison Square Garden. Four years later, the University of Connecticut womens basketball team won its hundredth straight game, defeating South Carolina 6655. And in 2010, one forecasteran octopus named Paulcorrectly predicted the outcome of all of Germanys matches in the FIFA World Cup. These are surprising eventsbut are they truly improbable? In Get in the Game , mathematician and sports analytics expert Tim Chartier helps us answer that questioncondensing complex mathematics down to coin tosses and dice throws to give readers both an introduction to statistics and a new way to enjoy sporting events. With these accessible tools, Chartier leads us through modeling experiments that develop our intuitive sense of the improbable. For example, to see how likely you are to beat Currys threepointer feat, consider his 45.3 percent threepoint shooting average in 201213. Take a coin and assume heads is making the shot slightly better than Curry at a fifty percent chance. Can you imagine getting heads eleven out of thirteen times?

But what is a good shot? Are all good shots created equally? And how might one identify players who are more or less likely to make and prevent those shots in the first place? The concept of basketball analytics, for lack of a better term, has been lauded, derided, and misunderstood. The incorporation of more data into NBA decisionmaking has been creditedor blamedfor everything from the death of the traditional center to the proliferation of threepoint shooting to the alleged abandonment of the area of the court known as the midrange. What is beyond doubt is that understanding its methods has never been more important to watching and appreciating the NBA. In The Midrange Theory , Seth Partnow, NBA analyst for The Athletic and former Director of Basketball Research for the Milwaukee Bucks, explains how numbers have affected the modern NBA game, and how those numbers seek not to solve the game of basketball but instead urge us toward thinking about it in new ways. The relative value of Russell Westbrooks tripledoubles Why some players succeed in the playoffs while others dont How NBA teams think about constructing their rosters through the draft and free agency The difficulty in measuring defensive achievement The fallacy of the quick two From shot selection to evaluating prospects to considering aesthetics and ethics while analyzing the box scores, Partnow deftly explores where the NBA is now, how it got here, and where it might be going next.

John Horgan If you want to know about AI, read this bookIt shows how a supposedly futuristic reverence for Artificial Intelligence retards progress when it denigrates our most irreplaceable resource for any future progress our own human intelligence. Peter Thiel Ever since Alan Turing, AI enthusiasts have equated artificial intelligence with human intelligence. A computer scientist working at the forefront of natural language processing, Erik Larson takes us on a tour of the landscape of AI to reveal why this is a profound mistake. AI works on inductive reasoning, crunching data sets to predict outcomes. But humans dont correlate data sets. We make conjectures, informed by context and experience. And we havent a clue how to program that kind of intuitive reasoning, which lies at the heart of common sense. Futurists insist AI will soon eclipse the capacities of the most gifted mind, but Larson shows how far we are from superintelligenceand what it would take to get there. Larson worries that were making two mistakes at once, defining human intelligence down while overestimating what AI is likely to achieveAnother concern is learned passivity our tendency to assume that AI will solve problems and our failure, as a result, to cultivate human ingenuity.

Already we increasingly rely on smart devices to the point that they are becoming extensions of our bodies. We are at a turning point for our species in which our natural humanity is gradually being converted into an artificial format that will lead to the loss of our souls. And, as Nigel Kerner reveals in astonishing detail, the blueprints for this future already exist. Kerner explains how there are civilizations in our universe that have developed advanced technologies to become entirely artificial. The Grey alien entities, reported in tens of thousands of abductions, appear to be biomachines, synthetic beings sent out as AI probes to gather information about something they lack that humans and other natural beings possess a soul. Examining scientific, historical, cultural, and religious evidence for Grey alien visitations as far back as 40,000 years ago, the author reveals that the Greys themselves set us on this path toward artificial intelligence millennia ago. Kerner shows how our intrinsic nature as human beings is no longer entirely human our natural consciousness and DNA have been hacked, and an artificial construct has been superimposed at the very foundation of our thinking processes. The author shows how our rush toward a technologically advanced, artificially intelligent future was seeded and precipitated by the Greys in order to control us and prepare us to fit in with their agenda for humanity. Revealing the secret alien hives on our planet, their connections to governments, and their ultimate endgame to harvest our souls and alter our DNA, Kerner also shows how, by developing yourself on a soul level, by recognizing your individual connection to divinity, you can protect your soul field and your consciousness from the Greys terrible manipulations.

However, it is more difficult to automate emotional intelligence, and this is where the human workers competitive advantage over machines currently lies. This book explores the impact of AI on everyday life, looking into workers adaptation to these changes, the ways in which managers can change the nature of jobs in light of AI developments, and the potential for humans and AI to continue working together. The book argues that AI is rapidly assuming a larger share of thinking tasks, leaving human intelligence to focus on feeling. The result is the Feeling Economy, in which both employees and consumers emphasize feeling to an unprecedented extent, with thinking tasks largely delegated to AI. The book shows both theoretical and empirical evidence that this shift is well underway. Further, it explores the effect of the Feeling Economy on our everyday lives in the areas such as shopping, politics, and education. Specifically, it argues that in this new economy, through empathy and people skills, women may gain an unprecedented degree of power and influence. This book will appeal to readers across disciplines interested in understanding the impact of AI on business and our daily lives. It represents a bold, potentially controversial attempt to gauge the direction in which society is heading. Read more"

Most of the information available on cloud computing is either highly technical, with details that are irrelevant to nontechnologists, or pure marketing hype, in which the cloud is simply a selling point. This book, however, explains the cloud from the users viewpointthe business users in particular. Nayan Ruparelia explains what the cloud is, when to use it and when not to, how to select a cloud service, how to integrate it with other technologies, and what the best practices are for using cloud computing. Cutting through the hype, Ruparelia cites the simple and basic definition of cloud computing from the National Institute of Science and Technology a model enabling ubiquitous, convenient, ondemand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. Thus with cloud computing, businesses can harness information technology resources usually available only to large enterprises. And this, Ruparelia demonstrates, represents a paradigm shift for business. It will ease funding for startups, alter business plans, and allow big businesses greater agility. Ruparelia discusses the key issues for any organization considering cloud computing service level agreements, business service delivery and consumption, finance, legal jurisdiction, security, and social responsibility. He introduces novel concepts made possible by cloud computing cloud cells, or specialist clouds for specific uses the personal cloud the cloud of things and cloud service exchanges. He examines use case patterns in terms of infrastructure and platform, software information, and business process and he explains how to transition to a cloud service.

Cloud Computing Solutions Architect: A Hands-On Approach: A Competency-based Textbook for Universities and a Guide for AWS Cloud Certification and Beyond  ,"Arshdeep Bahga, Vijay Madisetti",47  ,4.4,59.95,https://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Computing-Solutions-Architect-Hands/dp/0996025596/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=cloud+computing&qid=1669446495&sr=8-8,"A recent industry report from Gartner points out that choices related to cloud computing at enterprises have changed from if to how to build, deploy, consume, manage, secure and integrate cloud services into their operations. The cloud solutions architect is the person who defines the enterprise cloud strategy from a technical point of view and must take responsibility for rolling out these cloud services.Cloud computing is a transformative paradigm that enables scalable, convenient, ondemand access to a shared pool of configurable computing and networking resources, for efficiently delivering applications and services over the Internet. Amazon Web Services AWS, a leading provider of cloud platforms and services, defines a cloud solutions architect as one who can provide solution plans for the best architectural practices for cloud applications, can design and deploy highly scalable and faulttolerant services, can assist in lifting legacy applications and shifting them to the cloud, and can identify and plan for data entry and exit from the cloud platform, choose suitable cloud services based on data, compute, and security requirements. Further, the cloud solutions architect also ensures that enterprise offerings conform to sound principles, such as AWS WellArchitected Framework WAF for cloud applications and services. We have written this textbook, as part of our expanding A HandsOn Approach series, to meet this need at colleges and universities. This book is written as a textbook for training the next generation of cloud solutions architects for educational programs at colleges and universities, and also accompanying cloud certification programs where students would be interested in obtaining valuable handson skills on actual cloud platforms to further develop their knowledge and competency base. The typical reader is expected to have completed a couple of courses in programming using traditional highlevel languages at the college level, and is either a senior or a beginning graduate student in one of the science, technology, engineering or mathematics STEM fields. The reader is provided the necessary guidance and knowledge to develop working code for realworld cloud computing applications. Concurrent development of practical applications that accompanies traditional instructional material within the book further enhances the learning process, in our opinion. Furthermore, an accompanying website for this book httphandsonbooksseries.com contains additional support for instruction and learning.The book is organized into twenty chapters that provide indepth coverage of concepts, technologies, and architectures related to cloud computing environments and cloud applications. Realworld examples of cloudbased services and their characteristics are described. Reference architectures for different classes of cloud applications, including eCommerce, Banking, BusinesstoBusiness, Retail, and Social Networking in the context of commonly used design methodologies are examined in detail. The reader is also introduced to specialized aspects of cloud computing, including serverless computing, cloud security, and big data analytics. Case studies on the applications of the cloud in industry, healthcare, transportation systems, smart grids and education are provided.Through generous use of hundreds of figures and tested code samples, we have attempted to provide a rigorous no hype guide to cloud computing. It is expected that diligent readers of this book can use these exercises to develop their own applications on cloud platforms, such as those from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsofts Windows Azure. We adopted an informal approach to describing wellknown concepts primarily because these topics are covered well in existing textbooks, and our focus instead is on getting the reader firmly on track to developing robust cloud computing applications as opposed to more theory.
